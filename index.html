This step is vital for the success of the TLSS, as high-quality data directly influences the systemâ€™s effectiveness and reliability.</p>
  <h3>1.8.5 Data Labeling</h3>
  <p>To facilitate the development and functionality of the TLSS, we will categorize and label the collected data based on various criteria, including user preferences, feedback quality, and performance indicators. This labeling process, often referred to as data annotation, will allow us to identify patterns and trends that inform system design. By prioritizing accurate labeling, we will enhance the system's ability to provide personalized recommendations and insights, ultimately improving the overall user experience.</p>
  <h3>1.8.6 Fact-Finding techniques</h3>
  <h3>1.8.6.1 Interviews</h3>
  <p>To gather in-depth insights, we will conduct interviews with a diverse range of participants, including students, educators, and administrative personnel. These conversations will explore their experiences, challenges, and expectations regarding the TLSS. By formulating open-ended questions, we aim to encourage participants to share detailed accounts of their interactions with current educational practices, enabling us to identify specific areas where the new system can add value.</p>
  <h3>1.8.6.2 Surveys</h3>
  <p>In addition to interviews, we will implement surveys across the FTVTI community to collect quantitative data on user preferences and experiences. These surveys will be structured to gauge various aspects, including satisfaction with current systems, desired features in the new TLSS, and perceived barriers to effective learning. Analyzing the survey results will provide valuable insights into the collective voice of the community, guiding our development process and ensuring alignment with user needs.</p>
  <h3>1.8.6.3 Document Analysis</h3>
  <p>We will also conduct a thorough document analysis of existing literature, institutional reports, and case studies related to educational support systems. This research will help us identify best practices and successful strategies employed in similar contexts. By examining these resources, we can draw upon established methodologies and adapt them to the unique challenges faced by FTVTI, ensuring that our TLSS is informed by a solid foundation of knowledge.</p>
  <h3>1.8.7 Systems Analysis and Design</h3>
  <p>The design and analysis of the TLSS will be guided by Object-Oriented (OO) methodologies, which provide a structured framework for understanding and organizing the system's components. This approach allows us to break down the system into modular parts, each encapsulating specific functionalities and data. During the analysis phase, we will employ techniques such as use case modeling and class diagrams to define the interactions between system components, ensuring a clear understanding of user requirements and system capabilities.</p>
  <p>In the design phase, OO principles will inform the architecture of the TLSS, promoting scalability and flexibility. By utilizing concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism, we can create a system that is both maintainable and adaptable to evolving educational needs. This design strategy will ultimately enhance the system's longevity and effectiveness, allowing it to grow alongside the FTVTI community.</p>

    <h1>Chapter Two</h1>
    <h1>Description of the Existing System</h1>
    <p>The current Teaching and Learning Support System provides essential functionality for resource sharing between educators and students. It allows instructors to upload materials, enabling students to access notes, presentations, and assignments, which serves as a basic repository for course content. However, this structure focuses heavily on content storage and retrieval, offering limited interaction and analytics. Understanding its core functionality, strengths, weaknesses, and security is essential to identify gaps that the new system can address.</p>
    <h3>2.1.1 Major Functions of the Existing System</h3>
    <p>The existing system primarily functions as a central content repository where users can input and retrieve educational materials.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Input Process:</strong> User input revolves around account creation and login, resource uploading by instructors, and resource access by students. Educators upload documents, videos, and other learning aids, while students use the system to access these materials. Additionally, students can provide minimal feedback, often in the form of ratings or simple comments on the content. However, there is no option for students or teachers to interact directly through the platform, which limits collaborative learning and direct feedback mechanisms.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Processing Mechanism:</strong> Once data is uploaded, the system processes it primarily for storage and access, with minimal categorization or indexing for efficient retrieval. This process involves basic user authentication and user-data management. The system does offer a rudimentary form of tracking, recording which resources users have accessed, but lacks real-time analytics or tracking for individual progress.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Output:</strong> The output primarily includes access logs showing which materials were used and by whom, giving administrators a view of system usage. The system also provides limited reporting, mainly focused on login frequency and access records. However, it lacks advanced reporting or insights into student engagement with specific topics, making it difficult for educators to tailor content or track student progress accurately.

    <h3>2.1.2 Weaknesses and Strengths of the Existing System</h3>
    <p>The existing system does have strengths, but it also faces several limitations that impact its functionality and user satisfaction.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Strengths:</strong><br><br> One of the main advantages of the current system is its simplicity and ease of use, which allows users to navigate without extensive training. The platformâ€™s user-friendly design makes it easy for teachers to upload and organize materials and for students to access these resources. This straightforward design fulfills the minimum requirements for sharing educational content. Additionally, by centralizing resources, it creates a unified place where educational materials are stored, reducing the need for external tools for resource management.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Weaknesses:</strong><br><br> Despite its simplicity, the system lacks several critical functions. The limited interaction options mean that students and teachers are unable to engage directly within the platform. This absence of interactivity diminishes the learning experience and restricts collaborative opportunities. The system's tracking capabilities are also insufficient, as it cannot monitor detailed user behavior, individual learning progress, or performance analytics. Without these insights, educators find it difficult to identify and address student needs. Moreover, the limited categorization system hinders efficient retrieval of resources, often making it challenging for users to locate specific materials without a highly efficient search mechanism.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>2.2.3 Performance of the Existing System</h3>
    <p>While the system performs reliably under light loads, it struggles with scalability as the number of users and resources grows. High activity levels, such as during peak times at the beginning or
        17
        end of terms, can slow down response times and lead to delays in accessing content. Additionally, the lack of an optimized search function and insufficient indexing further contribute to performance issues, particularly as the volume of stored resources increases. Users may experience slow retrieval times, which negatively impacts the usability of the platform.</p>
    <h3>2.2.4 Security and Control</h3>
    <p>Security within the current system is basic, relying primarily on password-protected user accounts for access control. Neither user data is not strongly encrypted, nor are there measures such as two-factor authentication nor advanced data security protocols in place, leaving sensitive information vulnerable to unauthorized access. The absence of role-based access control (RBAC) means that users have uniform access rights, which restricts the system's flexibility in managing different user groups (e.g., administrators vs. students). Furthermore, without strong audit trails, the system lacks the ability to monitor and log detailed user activity, making it difficult to detect suspicious behavior or address potential security breaches proactively.</p>
